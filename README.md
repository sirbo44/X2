# Social-Network

## Description
This Python application simulates social media interactions by using graphs to represent relationships such as follows, likes, and comments among users. It employs the 'Graph' class from the 'graph' module to manage these connections. The software randomly generates usernames and creates random follow, like, and comment associations. Key features include calculating engagement rates, evaluating user influence, identifying the shortest paths of interaction, and determining the most engaging path.
